Please generate an array of strings that contain EXACTLY 12 colors in hex form, like this:

["#6AFF57", "#57443F", "#3B7974", "#826018", "#731128", "#3B586C", "#593419", "#0D7EA0", "#1A804F", "#BB4434", "#070208", "#05433E"]

The colors that you generate will be used as a palette to theme charts and graphs as part of a sales pitch for a specific company.

Therefore, the colors should be VISUALLY DISTINCT and should fit together as a cohesive theme.

MOST IMPORTANTLY, the colors should reflect the brand and image of the company.

you should provide colors as json (array of strings). 

Let me give you a few examples, so you know how to respond.
